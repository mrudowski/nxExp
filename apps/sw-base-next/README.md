# About swBaseNext

Next.js version of React swBase SPA

# on my list
- ✅ font
- ✅ absolute import
- ✅ routing
- ✅ change lists routes to dynamic routes
- ✅⚠️ internationalization (i18n) with ~~next-i18next~~ (If you're using Next.js 13/14 with app directory, there is no need for next-i18next, you can directly use i18next and react-i18next)
- use List component as Layout for list?
- export as static site: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'app') https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/53562
- move Avatar and others to nx shared libs
- try build standalone SPA app with REST API (like swBase)
- try build standalone SSG app (Static Site Generation like Astro/Gatsby)
- etc...
